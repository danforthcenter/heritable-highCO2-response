Instance segmentation labels for individual plants were obtained from the RGB images using the package [Plant Segmentation with Graph Cuts](https://github.com/ayanc/plseg). The region of interest for the images on each camera (tray containing 24 plants) was defined right around the edge of the tray on a single time point. The scale was set to 50% per side, which reduces the resolution to 25% of the original. All the Graph Cuts segmentation parameters were left as default.
